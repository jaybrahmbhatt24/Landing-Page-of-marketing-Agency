 A Landing Page is a standalone web page
 created for a specific marketing or promotional
 campaign, often linked from search engine
 marketing, email, or social media ads. It's
 designed to drive visitors toward a single call
to-action (CTA), such as signing up for a service,
 downloading an ebook, or purchasing a product.
 Landing Pages are tailored to increase
 conversions and typically contain compelling
 content, eye-catching visuals, and minimal
 distractions
